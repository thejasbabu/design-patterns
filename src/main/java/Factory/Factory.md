# Factory pattern

## What is it?
The factory pattern is used to replace class constructors, abstracting the process of object generation so that the type of the object instantiated can be determined at run-time.

Factory Method: creation through inheritance. Prototype: creation through delegation.

## Problem statement

A toy manufacturing factory creates different types of toy based on the mould used during the process.
